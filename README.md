# eng103a-ansible-testing Readme
The aim of this project was to run tests on services using ansible playbooks, if there were issues found with the services the pipeline would automatically trigger a playbook which would fix the issues. The status of the services being run can be monitored using Grafana and pulling data from the playbook. The diagram below shows the project layout.
